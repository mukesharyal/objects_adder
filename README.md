# 🎮 objects_adder

A **C++ OpenGL-based application** that renders a basic 3D world, including the ability to map and display 3D objects. This project explores foundational concepts in computer graphics and 3D rendering.

---

## ✨ Features

- **3D World Rendering**: Generates a basic 3D environment.
- **Object Mapping**: Load, render, and manipulate 3D objects within the scene.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: C++
- **Graphics Library**: OpenGL
- **Development Tools**:
  - GLFW (for window and input management)
  - GLEW (for OpenGL extension handling)
  - GLM (for math operations, like transformations and projections)

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 📦 Prerequisites

- **C++ Compiler**: Make sure a C++17-compatible compiler is installed.
- **OpenGL Environment**: Ensure OpenGL drivers are installed and up-to-date.
- **Dependencies**: GLFW, GLEW, GLM

### 📥 Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mee-lan/objects_adder.git
cd objects_adder
```

### 🧱 Build and Run

You can use a C++ IDE like **Visual Studio**, **CLion**, or **Code::Blocks**, or build manually using `g++`:

```bash
g++ main.cpp -lglfw -lGLEW -lGL -o 3dworld
./3dworld
```

Execute the application to render the 3D world.
